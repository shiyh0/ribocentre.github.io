  <p>Twister</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To establish RNA aptamers with high stability and expression levels, Jaffreyâ€™s group designed the Tornado (twister-optimized RNA for durable overexpression) expression system for rapid RNA circularization. They use a P3 twister U2A ribozyme and a P1 twister ribozyme to generate RNAs of interest containing a 5â€™ hydroxyl and 2â€™,3â€™-cyclic phosphate. Then the 5â€™ and 3â€™ ends would become substrates for RtcB-mediated ligation.Finally, the RNAs of interest would be circularized.</p>

<p>Schematic diagram for simple and effective generating in vitro transcripts with homogenous 5â€™ ends and 3â€™ ends. As show in this diagram, we use Hammerhead and HDV ribozymes to produce homogenous RNA with any 5â€™- and 3â€™- terminal sequence.</p>
